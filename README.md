## Welcome to Chonita's GitHub Page!
The purpose of this page is to practice setting up a webpage on GitHub.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Chonita1/gitexercise/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

aai used a GitHub Jekyll theme to run my webpage.

### Jekyll Themes

My website will use the layout and styles from the Cayman Jekyll theme I selected in my [repository settings](https://github.com/Chonita1/gitexercise/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

Enjoy!
